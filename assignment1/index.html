        <section id="questions" class="sections">


            <p class="question"><strong>Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular
                    detail.</strong></p>

            <p> On opening the website Next Wave, I was confronted with the bold text and overwhelming lines. I wasn’t
                immediately sure where to direct my mouse based on the home screen, so I right clicked on a random spot.
                Immediately the banner lifted and revealed the bulk of the website. I then hovered my mouse over the
                ‘About’ menu and the entire screen responded by italicising the text and changing the direction and
                curvature of the lines. From here, I hovered over every component of the page to see how it would
                respond. I toggled the lines (removing them), and then clicked onto “declutter”, after which the website
                switched to a basic html format. </p>

            <p><strong>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</strong></p>

            <p>The first thing that caught my attention on this website was the geometric lines. Even though they
                interceded with the text, I still found the overall layout to be crisp and aesthetically pleasing,
                rather than chaotic. </p>

            <p><strong>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</strong></p>

            <p> I spent a large portion of the experience interacting with the text to see how the geometric lines would
                respond. Beyond that, my primary interaction was with the colour bar and the “toggle graphic lines”
                button. I spent a lot of time enjoying the responsiveness of the text & lines. </p>

            <p><strong>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</strong></p>

            <p> The most common action in my experience was to “mouse hover” over the different components of the page.
                I didn’t click as often as I hovered, and this was an intentional choice to see how different elements
                on the page would respond to putting the mouse over them. </p>

            <p><strong>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</strong></p>

            <p> Next Wave’s goal appeared to be to communicate a series of events celebrating art & community. It
                offered times, locations, and events for the user to read up on. </p>

            <p><strong>How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</strong></p>

            <p> Next Wave uses a text menu labelled with About, Programs, What’s On, Donate, and News. Right-clicking
                each label brings up a menu that pans halfway across the screen and offers a sub-menu with further
                headings. Interacting with these sub-headings brings up further information in the form of text and
                images. In all, the website clearly communicated its primary goal in a concise manner. </p>

            <p><strong>What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are
                    intended to
                    interact with the experience?</strong></p>

            <p> I found interactions with the website to be generally short. Animations occurred within a second, and on
                interacting with the menu, the webpage did not need to be re-loaded nor did it open up a brand-new page.
                This implies that interactions on the website are intentionally short, and the information is condensed
                and readily available. It is meant to be easy to go back and forth between information, like we’re
                flipping through a program pamphlet. </p>

        </section>

        <div class="heading4">

        <h4>Week 3</h4>

        </div>

        <section id="part2" class="sections">

            <p><strong>What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</strong></p>

            <p> People generally have pre-existing perceptions about buttons and text. We open the program for an event
                and know that there will be headings such as “about” that will communicate the nature of the event. We
                know from common technology such as remotes and microwaves that we need to interact with a button in
                order to make something work. As such, this website utilises text that the user believes will lead them
                to the appropriate information; we know to mouse click “about”, because we have an association with the
                label, and instinctively know to press buttons. </p>

            <p><strong>What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with
                    it?</strong></p>

            <p> Given our historical understanding from paper-based programs and common technology, the reference
                suggests that we should interact by mouse-clicking. From there, we expect to receive relevant
                information. </p>

            <p><strong>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to
                    you?</strong></p>

            <p> The responsiveness of the geometric lines is very satisfying, and makes the website feel quite
                interactive. I found myself hovering over all of the different elements on the page in order to see how
                the text and lines would respond. Everything I hoped would have a response through mouse-hovering did
                have a response. </p>

            <p><strong>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to
                    you?</strong></p>

            <p> The most frustrating element of the interaction was the “access” button. When interacted with, it
                produces two pop ups, one over the other. It forces you to a view a video overlay before having to exit
                this particular pop up and access the rest of the about/access menu. Inherently, I don’t enjoy
                interacting with pop ups. </p>
